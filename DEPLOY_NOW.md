# üöÄ DEPLOY NOW - Quick Start Guide

## Your portfolio is ready! Follow these exact steps:

---

## ‚ö° STEP 1: Deploy to Netlify (2 minutes)

### What to do:
1. Open this link in your browser: **https://app.netlify.com/drop**
2. Create a free account (use email or GitHub)
3. Find your `dist` folder at this location on your computer:
   ```
   /Users/chinar.deshpande06/CD-THG/2025/THG-AI/MyCodingJourney/current-projects/sayali-portfolio/dist/
   ```
4. **DRAG the entire `dist` folder** into the Netlify Drop zone
5. Wait 30 seconds ‚è∞
6. **DONE!** Your site is live (you'll get a URL like `random-name-123.netlify.app`)

### What you'll see:
- A success message
- Your temporary URL
- A "Domain settings" button

---

## ‚ö° STEP 2: Add Your Domain (2 minutes)

### In Netlify (still on the same page):
1. Click **"Domain settings"** (or go to Site settings ‚Üí Domain management)
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Type: `sayalideshpandeportfolio.com`
4. Click **"Verify"**
5. Netlify will show you need DNS settings

### Copy these 2 values from Netlify:
- **A Record IP:** You'll see something like `75.2.60.5`
- **CNAME target:** Your site name like `your-site.netlify.app`

---

## ‚ö° STEP 3: Configure Wix DNS (5 minutes)

### Go to Wix:
1. Log in to **https://www.wix.com/**
2. Go to **"Domains"** (in left menu or top menu)
3. Click on **sayalideshpandeportfolio.com**
4. Find and click **"Manage DNS Records"** or **"DNS Settings"**

### Add these 2 records:

**Record #1 - A Record:**
```
Type: A
Host: @ (or leave blank)
Points to: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)
```
Click **"Save"** or **"Add Record"**

**Record #2 - CNAME Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Points to: [your-site-name].netlify.app
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)
```
Replace `[your-site-name]` with your actual Netlify site name

Click **"Save"** or **"Add Record"**

### Important:
- If Wix shows existing records for `@` or `www`, **DELETE them first**
- Keep any **MX records** (for email) if you have them
- Wix might warn you - that's OK, proceed anyway

---

## ‚ö° STEP 4: Wait & Verify (1-24 hours)

### Wait for DNS:
- Usually ready in 1-6 hours
- Can take up to 24 hours
- You'll get an email from Netlify when ready

### Check progress:
Go to: **https://dnschecker.org/** and enter `sayalideshpandeportfolio.com`
- Green checkmarks = DNS propagated ‚úÖ
- Red X = Still waiting ‚è≥

### SSL Certificate:
- Netlify automatically adds HTTPS (the green lock üîí)
- This happens automatically after DNS is configured
- Usually takes 1-2 minutes

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 5: Test Your Live Site!

### When DNS is ready, visit:
