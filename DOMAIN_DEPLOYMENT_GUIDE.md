# Deploying to sayalideshpandeportfolio.com

## Your Domain: sayalideshpandeportfolio.com

This guide will walk you through deploying your portfolio to your custom domain.

---

## ðŸš€ Recommended Option: Netlify (Easiest!)

Netlify is the best option because:
- âœ… Free forever for static sites
- âœ… Automatic SSL/HTTPS
- âœ… Custom domain setup is super simple
- âœ… Continuous deployment from Git (optional)
- âœ… Instant rollbacks if needed

### Step-by-Step Deployment with Netlify:

#### 1. Deploy Your Site

**Option A: Drag & Drop (Fastest - 2 minutes)**

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the entire `dist/` folder onto the page
3. Wait 30 seconds - your site is live!
4. You'll get a temporary URL like: `random-name-123456.netlify.app`

**Option B: Connect to Git (Recommended for updates)**

1. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
cd /Users/chinar.deshpande06/CD-THG/2025/THG-AI/MyCodingJourney/current-projects/sayali-portfolio
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Sayali Portfolio"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sayali-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
3. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
4. Choose GitHub and select your repository
5. Build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

#### 2. Configure Your Custom Domain

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings** â†’ **Domain management**
2. Click **Add custom domain**
3. Enter: `sayalideshpandeportfolio.com`
4. Netlify will show you DNS settings

#### 3. Update Your Domain DNS

You need to point your domain to Netlify. You have two options:

**Option A: Use Netlify Nameservers (Recommended - Easiest)**

1. In your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):
2. Update nameservers to Netlify's:
   ```
   dns1.p03.nsone.net
   dns2.p03.nsone.net
   dns3.p03.nsone.net
   dns4.p03.nsone.net
   ```
3. Wait 1-24 hours for DNS propagation
4. Done! Netlify handles everything including SSL

**Option B: Keep Your Current DNS Provider**

Add these records in your DNS settings:

**For root domain (sayalideshpandeportfolio.com):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
```

**For www subdomain:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [your-site-name].netlify.app
```

#### 4. Enable HTTPS (Automatic!)

- Netlify automatically provisions SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- Usually takes 1-2 minutes after DNS is configured
- Your site will be accessible via `https://sayalideshpandeportfolio.com`

#### 5. Configure Site Settings (Optional but Recommended)

In Netlify dashboard:

1. **Redirects** - Add this file to your `public/` folder:

Create `public/_redirects`:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This ensures React Router works correctly.

2. **Forms** - Already works out of the box! Your contact form will automatically work.
