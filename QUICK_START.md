# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Sayali Portfolio

## Your Website is Ready to Deploy! ✅

Everything has been built, tested, and packaged. Here's what you need to know:

## 📦 What You Have

Your portfolio website is in the `dist/` folder (29MB total):
- ✅ Optimized HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ✅ All images and company logos
- ✅ Resume PDF
- ✅ Project content
- ✅ Everything needed for a live website

## 🎯 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended - Easiest!)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Drag and drop the `dist/` folder onto the page
3. Done! Your site is live in seconds

**That's it!** Netlify will give you a URL like: `your-name.netlify.app`

Want a custom domain? Just configure it in Netlify settings.

### Option 2: Vercel (Developer-Friendly)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (one time)
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy (from project root)
vercel --prod

# Follow the prompts - it takes 30 seconds!
```

---

### Option 3: GitHub Pages (Free Forever)

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Upload your project files
3. Go to Settings → Pages
4. Select "Deploy from a branch" → main → /dist
5. Your site will be live at: `username.github.io/repo-name`

---

### Option 4: Your Own Domain/Server

1. Upload the **contents** of the `dist/` folder to your web server
2. Point your domain to that folder
3. Make sure your server serves `index.html` for all routes

**Apache:** Add the `.htaccess` file from DEPLOYMENT.md
**Nginx:** Use the config from DEPLOYMENT.md
