My journey has taken me from ISDI Parsons (India) to the Royal College of Art, London, collaborating with organizations like the NHS and Local‑to‑Local on human‑centered projects. I believe design is not decoration — it’s dialogue. It listens before it acts. My practice focuses on clarity, empathy, and translating insights into usable, thoughtful systems. When I’m not designing, you’ll find me sketching, traveling, or studying how small interactions shape trust between people and technology.",
