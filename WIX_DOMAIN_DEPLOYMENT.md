### Part 2: Configure Wix DNS Settings (10 minutes)

Since your domain is with Wix, you need to point it to Netlify.

#### Option A: Point Domain to Netlify (Recommended)

**In Wix:**

1. Log in to your Wix account
2. Go to **Domains** (or **My Domains**)
3. Click on `sayalideshpandeportfolio.com`
4. Look for **DNS Settings** or **Manage DNS**
5. You'll need to add these records:

**Add A Record:**
```
Type: A
Host: @
Points to: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)
```

**Add CNAME Record for www:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Points to: [your-netlify-site].netlify.app
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)
```

6. Save changes

#### Option B: Transfer DNS to Netlify (Advanced)

If Wix allows external DNS management:

1. In Wix, find **Nameservers** settings
2. Change to **Custom nameservers**
3. Use Netlify's nameservers:
   ```
   dns1.p03.nsone.net
   dns2.p03.nsone.net
   dns3.p03.nsone.net
   dns4.p03.nsone.net
   ```
4. Save changes

---

### Part 3: Wait for DNS Propagation (1-24 hours)

- Usually takes 1-6 hours
- Can take up to 24-48 hours
- Check status at: https://dnschecker.org/#A/sayalideshpandeportfolio.com

---

### Part 4: Enable HTTPS (Automatic)

1. Once DNS is configured, go to Netlify dashboard
2. Go to **Domain settings â†’ HTTPS**
3. Netlify will automatically provision SSL certificate
4. Takes 1-2 minutes
5. Your site will be secure! ðŸ”’
