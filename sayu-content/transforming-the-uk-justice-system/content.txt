Transforming the UK Justice System: A Framework for Neurodivergent Support Services

**Brief**
In 2022 the U.K. Parliament approved *Oasis Restore*, a secure school in Kent for young offenders aged 16–19.  Run by Oasis Community Learning, the school is built on restorative justice.  The challenge was clear: incoming students have negative perceptions of authority.  To succeed the school needed trust at its foundation.

**Intervention & Impact**
The team proposed the **Shared‑Experience Mentor (SEM) Program**, a new role in the school ecosystem.  SEMs are dedicated mentors who build trust, advocate for students and help tailor lesson plans and activities to individual needs, particularly for neurodivergent children.  By emphasising empathy over punishment, the program aims to prepare young people for life beyond the justice system and reduce re‑offending.

**My Role**
Working in a team of three, Sayali co‑designed the SEM program with educators, justice stakeholders and the Oasis leadership.  She facilitated workshops, developed service blueprints and staff guides, and presented the concept to the Principal Director of Oasis Restore and representatives from the Ministry of Justice.

**Research & Insights**
The team interviewed justice officials, educators and subject‑matter experts; analysed the secure‑school site; and synthesised insights about children in and outside the justice system.  Findings revealed that neurodiversity is largely overlooked—children with undiagnosed conditions face punishment rather than support.  Young people often come from trauma and deprivation, yet the system focuses on behaviour, not empathy.  Positive relationships, self‑advocacy and role models emerged as key drivers of change.

**Area of Opportunity**
Introduce the SEM role to provide positive role models who nurture healthy relationships and guide students toward constructive futures.  Healthy, stable relationships during a young person’s time in the secure school can significantly reduce re‑offending.

**Theory of Change**
If students build trust with a mentor who shares similar lived experiences, they gain confidence, develop self‑advocacy and are more likely to leave the system with positive life paths.  The SEM works closely with teachers to tailor lessons to each child’s neurodivergent profile and trauma history, supports students through difficult moments, and serves as a bridge between students and staff.

**Implementation & Learnings**
The project developed a mentorship toolkit and ran co‑creation workshops to prototype engagement artefacts.  Feedback showed that the mentor’s natural rapport mattered more than the tools themselves, prompting a shift to refining the hiring process.  Ultimately the SEM program isn’t just a new job description; it’s a systemic change that influences the entire school culture.  In the long term the team envisions a network of former mentors and students who support one another beyond the facility.
